:SHELL_CMD_MEM_HELP_LONG
Displays the DOS memory information.

Usage:
  [32;1mmem[0m

Where:
  This command has no parameters.

Notes:
  This command shows the DOS memory status, including the free conventional
  memory, UMB (upper) memory, XMS (extended) memory, and EMS (expanded) memory.

Examples:
  [32;1mmem[0m

.
:SHELL_CMD_LOADFIX_HELP_LONG
Loads a program in the specific memory region and then runs it.

Usage:
  [32;1mloadfix[0m [36;1mGAME[0m [37;1m[PARAMETERS][0m
  [32;1mloadfix[0m [/d] (or [/f])[0m

Where:
  [36;1mGAME[0m is a game or program to be loaded, optionally with parameters.

Notes:
  The most common use cases of this command are to fix DOS games or programs
  which show either the "[37;1mPacked File Corrupt[0m" or "[37;1mNot enough memory"[0m (e.g.,
  from some 1980's games such as California Games II) error message when run.
  Running [32;1mloadfix[0m without an argument simply allocates memory for your game
  to run; you can free the memory with either /d or /f option when it finishes.

Examples:
  [32;1mloadfix[0m [36;1mmygame[0m [37;1margs[0m
  [32;1mloadfix[0m /d

.
:SHELL_CMD_AUTOTYPE_HELP_LONG
Performs scripted keyboard entry into a running DOS game.

Usage:
  [32;1mautotype[0m -list
  [32;1mautotype[0m [-w [37;1mWAIT[0m] [-p [37;1mPACE[0m] [36;1mBUTTONS[0m

Where:
  [37;1mWAIT[0m    is the number of seconds to wait before typing begins (max of 30).
  [37;1mPACE[0m    is the number of seconds before each keystroke (max of 10).
  [36;1mBUTTONS[0m is one or more space-separated buttons.

Notes:
  The [36;1mBUTTONS[0m supplied in the command will be autotyped into running DOS games
  after they start. Autotyping begins after [36;1mWAIT[0m seconds, and each button is
  entered every [37;1mPACE[0m seconds. The [36;1m,[0m character inserts an extra [37;1mPACE[0m delay.
  [37;1mWAIT[0m and [37;1mPACE[0m default to 2 and 0.5 seconds respectively if not specified.
  A list of all available button names can be obtained using the -list option.

Examples:
  [32;1mautotype[0m -list
  [32;1mautotype[0m -w [37;1m1[0m -p [37;1m0.3[0m [36;1mup enter , right enter[0m

Usage:
  [32;1mmixer[0m [36;1mCHANNEL[0m [37;1mVOLUME[0m [/noshow]
  [32;1mmixer[0m [/listmidi][0m

Where:
  [36;1mCHANNEL[0m is the sound channel you want to change the volume.
  [37;1mVOLUME[0m  is an integer between 0 and 100 representing the volume.

Notes:
  Running [32;1mmixer[0m without an argument shows the volumes of all sound channels.
  You can view available MIDI devices and user options with /listmidi option.
  You may change the volumes of more than one sound channels in one command.
  The /noshow option causes mixer not to show the volumes when making a change.

Examples:
  [32;1mmixer[0m
  [32;1mmixer[0m [36;1mmaster[0m [37;1m50[0m [36;1mrecord[0m [37;1m60[0m /noshow

Where:
  [36;1mDRIVE[0m is the drive to scan for changes.

Notes:
  - Running [32;1mrescan[0m without an argument scans for changes of the current drive.
  - Changes to this drive made on the host will then be reflected inside DOS.
  - You can also scan for changes on all mounted drives with the /a option.

Examples:
  [32;1mrescan[0m [36;1mc:[0m
  [32;1mrescan[0m /a

.
:PROGRAM_INTRO_CDROM_WINDOWS
[2J[32;1mHow to mount a virtual CD-ROM Drive in DOSBox:[0m
DOSBox provides CD-ROM emulation on several levels.

This works on all normal directories, installs MSCDEX and marks the files
read-only. Usually this is enough for most games:

[34;1mmount D C:\example -t cdrom[0m

If it doesn't work you might have to tell DOSBox the label of the CD-ROM:

[34;1mmount D C:\example -t cdrom -label CDLABEL[0m

Additionally, you can use imgmount to mount iso or cue/bin images:

[34;1mimgmount D C:\cd.iso -t cdrom[0m

[34;1mimgmount D C:\cd.cue -t cdrom[0m

.

Where:
  [37;1mDRIVE[0m is a drive to boot from, must be [37;1mA:[0m, [37;1mC:[0m, or [37;1mD:[0m.
  [36;1mIMAGEFILE[0m is one or more floppy images, separated by spaces.

Notes:
  A DOS drive letter must have been mounted previously with [32;1mimgmount[0m command.
  The DOS drive or disk image must be bootable, containing DOS system files.
  If more than one disk images are specified, you can swap them with a hotkey.

Examples:
  [32;1mboot[0m [37;1mc:[0m
  [32;1mboot[0m [36;1mdisk1.ima disk2.ima[0m

  [37;1mCODEPAGE[0m     is a code page number, such as [37;1m437[0m and [37;1m850[0m.
  CODEPAGEFILE is a file containing information for a code page.

Notes:

  and code page. It will change to [36;1mLANGCODE[0m if provided, optionally with a
  [37;1mCODEPAGE[0m and an additional CODEPAGEFILE to load the specified code page
  number and code page file if provided. This command is especially useful if
  you use a non-US keyboard, and [36;1mLANGCODE[0m can also be set in the configuration
  file under the [dos] section using the "keyboardlayout = [36;1mLANGCODE[0m" setting.

:SHELL_CMD_COMMAND_HELP_LONG
Starts the DOSBox Staging command shell.
Usage:
  [32;1mcommand[0m
  [32;1mcommand[0m /c (or /init) [36;1mCOMMAND[0m

Where:
  [36;1mCOMMAND[0m is a DOS command, game, or program to run.

Notes:
  DOSBox Staging automatically starts a DOS command shell by invoking this
  command with /init option when it starts, which shows the welcome banner.
  You can load a new instance of the command shell by running [32;1mcommand[0m.
  Adding a /c option along with [36;1mCOMMAND[0m allows this command to run the
  specified command (optionally with parameters) and then exit automatically.

Examples:
  [32;1mcommand[0m
  [32;1mcommand[0m /c [36;1mecho[0m [37mHello world![0m
  [32;1mcommand[0m /init [36;1mdir[0m

.
:SHELL_CMD_PAUSE_HELP_LONG
Usage:
  [32;1mpause[0m

Where:

Notes:
  This command is especially useful in batch programs to allow a user to
  continue the batch program execution with a key press. The user can press
  any key on the keyboard (except for certain control keys) to continue.

Examples:
  [32;1mpause[0m

.
:SHELL_CMD_CLS_HELP_LONG
Usage:
  [32;1mcls[0m

Where:
  This command has no parameters.

Notes:
  Running [32;1mcls[0m clears all texts on the DOS screen, except for the command
  prompt (e.g. [37;1mZ:\>[0m or [37;1mC:\GAMES>[0m) on the top-left corner of the screen.

Examples:
  [32;1mcls[0m

.
:SHELL_CMD_ECHO_HELP_LONG
Usage:
  [32;1mecho[0m [36;1m[on|off][0m

Where:
  [36;1mon|off[0m  Turns on/off command echoing.
  [36;1mMESSAGE[0m The message to display.

Notes:

Examples:
  [32;1mexit[0m

.
:SHELL_CMD_EXIT_TOO_SOON
Preventing an early 'exit' call from terminating.

.
:SHELL_CMD_HELP_HELP_LONG
Usage:

Notes:
  - Running [32;1mecho[0m without an argument displays a DOS command list.
  - You can view a full list of internal commands with the /a or /all option.
  - Instead of [32;1mhelp[0m [36;1mCOMMAND[0m, you can also get command help with [36;1mCOMMAND[0m /?.

Examples:
  [32;1mhelp[0m [36;1mdir[0m
  [32;1mhelp[0m /all

  The [36;1merrorlevel[0m condition is useful for checking if a programs ran correctly.
  If either [37;1mSTR1[0m or [37;1mSTR2[0m may be empty, you can enclose them in quotes (").
